## Research Use Statement (RUS)
```Please enter your RUS in the area below. The RUS should be one or two paragraphs in length and include research objectives, the study design, and an analysis plan (including the phenotypic characteristics that will be tested for association with genetic variants). If you are requesting multiple datasets, please describe how you will use them. Examples of RUS can be found at GDS website. Please limit your RUS to 4500 characters.```


Immuno-therapy has shown deep and durable responses in multiple myeloma. However, relapse following therapy is frequently observed, and mechanisms of resistance remain ill-defined.  Recent reports have proposed possible resistance mechanisms against MM therapy.  In this study, we seek to explore if multiple myeloma relapse patients share common genomic variations and transcriptomic changes that may explain tumor cell resistances to multiple myeloma specific treatment. We plan to utilize our pipeline and analysis tools to identify SNP, indel, and CNV patterns from whole exome sequence data for closer examination on the proposed therapeutic resistance pathways.  Furthermore,  we will obtain mRNA expressions from RNA-Seq data to integrate


Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most popular soft tissue pediatric sarcoma. We plan to utilize our pipeline to identify fusions and obtain mRNA
expressions from RNA-seq data. The goal is to identify the relationships between gene expression and PAX gene rearrangement in RMS subtypes.
The data types requested by this project include RNA-seq data, metadata and processed data. Using the processed data, we may be able to identify
the correlation between gene expression and fusion events. We are planning to analyze raw data (BAM and fastq files) using our inhouse pipeline to
confirm the reported fusion events and gene expression. The data from this dataset will only be used in research consistent with the data use
limitation of this study (phs000720) and will not be combined with other datasets of other phenotypes. The data can improve our understanding of
PAX gene rearrangement in RMS and suggest new therapeutic strategy. The results will be shared with scientific community in the format of
conference presentation or peer reviewed publication.


## Cloud Use Statement
```Describe the type(s) of cloud computing service(s) you wish to obtain (e.g., PaaS, SaaS, IaaS, DaaS) and how you plan to use it (them) to carry out the work described in your Research Use Statement (e.g., datasets to be included, process for data transfer, analysis, and storage, and tools and/or software to be used). Also describe the role of any collaborators. Please limit your statement to 2000 characters.```

### Example: AWS 
We are planning to use AWS in two ways: 1. We will use AWS as our infrastructure service provider where we will be running bioinformatics pipelines, such as our internally developed DifferentialSplicing detection pipeline, to process RNAseq BAM files from TCGA. 2. We will also use AWS to host both exome-seq and RNAseq BAM files, and allow user controlled access to them when users need to visualize BAM files using genomics viewers, such as IGV. We will be using Amazon Web Services for RNAseq and Exomeseq data processing. Initial review of our AWS security procedure/practices shows that our internal practice is consistent with the best practice outlined in NIH Security Best Practices for Controlled-Access Data Subject to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy. Data will only be hosted and processed in AWS after official review and approval by IT department. Occasionally we will use the Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) from Seven Bridge Genomics (SBG), which is also AWS based. Seven Bridges exists to make biomedical data analysis easy at industrial scale. SBG's flagship product, developed and honed through numerous national and commercial research and clinical partnerships, is the Seven Bridges Platform (the “Platform”). The Seven Bridges Platform is a cloud-based environment for conducting bioinformatic analyses. It is a central hub for teams to store, analyze, and jointly interpret their bioinformatic data. The Platform co-locates analysis pipelines alongside the largest genomic datasets to optimize processing. It allocates storage and compute resources on demand, to meet the needs of ever-growing analyses.
