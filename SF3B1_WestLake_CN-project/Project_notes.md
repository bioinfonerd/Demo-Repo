# SF3B1 Mutations affecting Cancer
## Background
- Core components of spliceosome are targeted by many cancer-derived mutations 
- SF3B1 mutations led to dysregulated RNA splicing
- Cancer-driving mutations of SF3B1 are clustered in the RNA path

## Study
- In this study, we identified two new proteins binding at the RNA path of SF3B1. These residues are frequently mutated in cancer: R625, H662, K666, K700, K741
- Given our structural observation, we propose that mutations targeting SF3B1 RNA path led to crippled PRP5 binding, and consequently are responsible for splicing dysregulation as observed in cancer cells.
- To test this hypothesis, we performed RNA-seq experiment to verify if PRP5 mutations phenocopy SF3B1 mutations, and if over-expression of wildtype (WT) PRP5 could rescue the splicing defects caused by SF3B1 mutation.

## Samples
Twelve samples with 3 replicates each
