# Immunitas
Github Examples for Sr. Computational Biologist position 

# Project Organization

As I have been involved with several organizations and projects, that have their repositories, it would be easier to format it into a single GitHub repository. The examples I selected relate to single-cell, immunology, oncology, and data processing. To protect the proprietary nature of some of these projects, I have replaced the company's name. In total, 17 projects are highlighted to cover the scope. Some of these projects I was the only coder or analyst, but others were collaborative, so the format and style will be different.
