# Project Organization

I have been involved with several organizations and projects, each with its own repository. To streamline this, I have consolidated these projects into a single GitHub repository. The selected examples span various fields, including single-cell research, immunology, oncology, and data processing. To maintain confidentiality, I have anonymized company names except for H3 Biomedicine, which has since ceased operations. This repository highlights 17 projects in total, covering a broad scope of my work. While some projects were solely my responsibility as a coder or analyst, others were collaborative efforts, resulting in variations in format and style.

### 1. BCMA-SMLA-project

Cancer cells commonly develop resistance to immunotherapy by loss of antigen expression. Here, we use our CRISPR interference– and CRISPR activation–based functional genomics platform to systematically identify pathways controlling cell surface expression of the multiple myeloma immunotherapy antigen B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). We discovered that pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC7 and the Sec61 complex increased cell surface BCMA. This contains the analysis that led to discovering those pathways and targets that led to an expanded project. 

### 2. CyCif_Manager-master-project

The CyCIF Manager project aims to provide a streamlined pipeline platform for CyCIF (Cyclic Immunofluorescence) analysis, both on local machines and on the O2 cluster at Harvard Medical School (HMS). This project includes infrastructure for managing and analyzing high-dimensional imaging data, essential for research in fields like immunology and oncology. The platform ensures consistent and efficient processing of CyCIF data, facilitating the integration of different datasets and enhancing reproducibility in analysis.

Key features of the CyCIF Manager include scripts and tools for setting up the necessary environments, managing pipeline versions, and processing example datasets. The repository also includes detailed documentation and installation guides to help users deploy and utilize the pipeline effectively.
