# Immunitas
Github Examples for Sr. Computational Biologist position 

# Project Organization

I have been involved with several organizations and projects, each with its own repository. To streamline this, I have consolidated these projects into a single GitHub repository. The selected examples span various fields, including single-cell research, immunology, oncology, and data processing. To maintain confidentiality, I have anonymized company names except for H3 Biomedicine, which has since ceased operations. This repository highlights 17 projects in total, covering a broad scope of my work. While some projects were solely my responsibility as a coder or analyst, others were collaborative efforts, resulting in variations in format and style.
